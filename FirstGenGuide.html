                <p><b><i>Leana Wen</i></b></p>
                <p id="description">Dr. Wen was born in Shanghai China. At age seven, her family fled from China in order to escape the Tiananmen Massacre. They arrived in the United States with only $40. She grew up in Compton, California and later moved to Baltimore where she has worked to expand health care and reproductive rights. She was a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wen has held multiple positions, such as the president of the American Medical Student Association and a volunteer at Planned Parenthood, and was named as one of the Top 25 Minority Executives in Healthcare.

                <p><b><i>Ursula Burns</i></b></p>
                <p id="description">Burns and her three siblings were raised by their mother in a Manhattan low-income housing project. In order to have Burns attend a Catholic preparatory school, her mother worked multiple jobs. Now that Burns has had a successful career, she has been outspoken about growing up in poverty and has mentored and encouraged women and people of color to enter the tech industry. Burns wants others to know that being a black female is an advantage, because she used her differences to set herself apart from others. One of her pieces of advice is “Never waste a good crisis,” because it was during some trying moments when she gained an incredible experience.
