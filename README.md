# Project-Empower-2.0
This repository will be used to gather all the code needed for a project in the hackathon.

# Overview
This project is designed to help first-generation, low-income students choose and get into the right colleges. Our website provides essential tips, information, and motivation to guide you through the process. We offer a tuition calculator to estimate the cost of In-State and Out-of-State tuition for your chosen college. Additionally, our motivational generator will randomly provide inspiring quotes to keep you motivated. You can also read success stories from others who have achieved their goals and share your own story in the "Share Your Story" section.
