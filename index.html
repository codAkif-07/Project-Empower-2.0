An example of such an application would be the <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common App</a>, which most colleges use as their application system. To apply to colleges you will also need additional information.</p>
            <ul>

                    <li><b>Follow-Up:</b> Check application status and respond to any additional requests from colleges.</li>
                </div>
            </ul>
            <p><b>NOTE</b></p>
            <p>Apart from traditional college, there are several other valuable paths you might also be interested in.

                <p><b><i>Leana Wen</i></b></p>
                <p id="description">Dr. Leana Wen is an American physician who is the former president of Planned Parenthood, making it almost half a century since a doctor has held this role at the organization. At age 18, Dr. Wen graduated summa cum laude from Cal State University, Los Angeles, and went on to get her medical degree from Washington University School of Medicine. She then became a Rhodes Scholar and attended the University of Oxford for her master’s degree. Following that, she was a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wen has held multiple positions, such as the president of the American Medical Student Association and a volunteer at Planned Parenthood, and was named one of the Top 25 Minority Executives in Healthcare. Aside from her current work in Planned Parenthood, she is also Baltimore’s Commissioner of Health.<br><br>Dr. Wen was born in Shanghai China. At age seven, her family fled from China to escape the Tiananmen Massacre. They arrived in the United States with only $40. She grew up in Compton, California, and later moved to Baltimore where she has worked to expand health care and reproductive rights.

                <p><b><i>Ursula Burns</i></b></p>
                <p id="description">Ursula Burns is the former CEO of Xerox, making her the first black female CEO of a Fortune 500 company. After high school, she attended the Polytechnic Institute of New York University and earned a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering. After completing her Master’s in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University, Burns joined Xerox and eventually became its CEO in 2009. Some of her many accomplishments include being named one of the most influential women in 2015 by Forbes, being appointed as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Ford Foundation, and serving as the Vice President of the President’s Export Council in 2010.<br><br>Burns and her three siblings were raised by their mother in a Manhattan low-income housing project. To have Burns attend a Catholic preparatory school, her mother worked multiple jobs. Now that Burns has had a successful career, she has been outspoken about growing up in poverty and has mentored and encouraged women and people of color to enter the tech industry. Burns wants others to know that being a black female is an advantage because she used her differences to set herself apart from others. One of her pieces of advice is “Never waste a good crisis,” because it was during some trying moments when she gained an incredible experience.
